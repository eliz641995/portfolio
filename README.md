# Data Scientist 

## Education  
- M.A, Data Science | The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (_Sep 2024_)
  - Dissertation title :“A new method for gene-based interactions in GWAS” under supervision of Dr. Or Zuk. Designed novel algorithms using Python and R to 
    identify interactions between genetic variants and environmental factors in complex diseases. This approach significantly improved the prediction accuracy of 
    life-threatening diseases.
  - Collaborated with Tel Aviv University to build predictive and classification models forecasting fertility trends among Israeli women 40+, identifying key 
    factors to guide policymakers and healthcare professionals.
- B.A, Economics and Management	| Tel Aviv University (_June 2019_)
