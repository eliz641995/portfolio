# Data Scientist 

## Education  
- M.A, Data Science | The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (_Sep 2024_)
  - Dissertation title: “A new method for gene-based interactions in GWAS” under supervision of Dr. Or Zuk. Designed algorithms to identify interactions between 
    genetic variants and environmental factors. Achieved 0.9 AUC,enhancing prediction accuracy for life-threatening conditions. 
  - Built predictive models to forecast total fertility trends among Israeli women using econometric and causal inference techniques (panel regression, DiD). 
    Attained an MSE of 1.2 and identified key factors influencing reproductive decisions. 
- B.A, Economics and Management	| Tel Aviv University (_June 2019_)
